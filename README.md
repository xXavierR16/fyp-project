About this repo:
  To detect whether a URL link is Benign or Ransomware by training 3 machine learning models and stack all using Logistic Regression.
  Used Google Colab from data preprocessing to evaluation, download the result as .pkl file and upload here.

Machine Learning and Deep Learning chosen:
  Random Forest, LinearSVC, CNN.

  
The ML changed from SVM to LinearSVC, as LinearSVC provide a linear implementation of SVM optimized for speed and large datasets.
